# Intro
Hello! If you've stumbled upon this repo, then welcome.

This repository was made with the intention of providing examples for my boyfriend to learn coding from. Every example has some incorrect code that needs to be fixed, making every project a little puzzle to solve as a way to learn GDScript (and to refresh my own memory on the language since I moved to C# many years ago.)

Each project is styled like a WarioWare microgame, which lets me make examples quickly while prioritizing learning one concept at a time. I aim for each microgame to be quickly beaten while showcasing some neat things about Godot.

# Why WarioWare?
**because its fun.**

In all seriousness though, it's because I kept hearing the WarioWare DIY music as I worked on this, which lead to me kinda loosely theming the projects around WarioWare.

WarioWare has always held a place in my heart since WarioWare DIY, so I thought I would pay tribute to it by making all these lessions microgames.

# Legal
- Feel free to use the code in this repo for free (though credit would be nice).
- I do not own the sound effects in this repo. Many of the sounds are ripped from various WarioWare games and are property of Nintendo.

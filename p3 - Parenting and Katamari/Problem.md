# Project 3 - Parenting and Katamari

**Goal: To make a small Katamari Damacy minigame**

## Problems
- The Katamari looks left when you let go of the movement keys.
- The Katamari doesn't rotate fast enough.
- `SimpleWinCounter.gd`'s `on_count_updated()` function isn't emitting the signal it is meant to.
- The Spawner isn't spawning people. (Hint: Check the inspector panel)
- The prince isn't in the scene.
